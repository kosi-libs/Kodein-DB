[.lead]
_**Kodein-DB**_ is a Kotlin/Multiplatform embedded NoSQL database that works on JVM, Android, Kotlin/Native and iOS.
It is suited for client or mobile applications.

CAUTION: Under no circumstances should it be used in a server!

._**Kodein-DB**_ allows you to:
- easily store, retrieve and query kotlin objects
- stop caring about schema definitions
- easily set up a new project

._**Kodein-DB**_ is a good choice because it:
- proposes a very simple and readable DSL
- integrates nicely with Android and iOS
- offers very good performances
- is just Kotlin!

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Kodein-DB is in beta.*

Although, we do use Kodein-DB in production, this means we cannot ensure the library's correctness and stability.
Therefore, we ask that you first try Kodein-DB in non-critical applications, and report any mis-behaviour you may encounter.

== Example

[source,kotlin]
.A simple example
----
val db = DB.open("path/to/db")

db.put(User("John", "Doe"))
db.put(User("Jane", "Doe"))
db.put(User("Someone", "Else"))

val does = db.find<User>().byIndex("lastName", "Doe").models()
println(does.joinToString()) // Jane, John
